phantasia  -  a game from the freebsd-games package made by Ted E. @ AT&T in 1986.
ported to andorid with clang in termux in 2021. 

Install :

1 download and install termux with a writeable home directory configured.

2 mkdir p

3 cd p

4 wget https://github.com/QuadDerrick/games/blob/main/phantasia.zip?raw=true

5 unzip phantasia.zip\?raw\=true

6 chmod a+x the phantasia file

7 ./phantasia

note, use the directory name "p" as the binary is compiled to run under this directory,
or if you want to do it the manual way, download bsd-games , extract phantasia , compile it with clang in termux.

good luck =)
